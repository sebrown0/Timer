# Timer
An incrmental timer developed for the car dealership project.
This code is not supposed to 're-invent' the wheel for the sake of it.
I know that there are libraries out there that will do the same thing, better.
It is meant for me to get practice of Dependency Injection and default methods in interfaces.
